    <h1>Lung Segmentation</h1>
    <h3>Developing ML models to create lung masks from chest X-rays.</h3>
    <p>
      Segmentation of lungs in chest x-rays is a necessary first step for lung image analysis and serves as a prerequisite to provide accurate lung disease diagnosis. While there have been many CNNs for lung segmentation developed in Tensorflow, not much has been done in Tensorflow.js, Tensorflow's alternative library using Javascript. Javascript has predominantly served as a front-end framework, but over recent years many back-end and tools have been published.

    <p>
      An advantage of using Tensorflow.js over Tensorflow is that it provides machine learning tools entirely on the client-side. This means with Tensorflow.js, creating lung segmentations of a chest x-ray requires no server requests as the mask is done in the web browser. Doctors who use this tool do not have to fear patient data and records being transmitted to an unknown server as this can be a patient privacy issue.

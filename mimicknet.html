    <h3>Reducing Noise in Ultrasound Imaging with GANs.</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, ultrasound scanners are susceptible to many sources of image degradation. Post-processing techniques are often required to reduce noise and generate an image that a doctor can evaluate with. Unfortunately, commercial post-processing algorithms are often proprietary. As a result, researchers at Duke developed a version of this image processing technique with machine learning models.

    <p>
      An advantage of using Tensorflow.js over Tensorflow is that it provides machine learning tools entirely on the client-side. This means with Tensorflow.js, creating lung segmentations of a chest x-ray requires no server requests as the mask is done in the web browser. Doctors who use this tool do not have to fear patient data and records being transmitted to an unknown server as this can be a patient privacy issue.

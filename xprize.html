    <h1>Rainforest Conservation with Drones</h1>
    <h2>Developing drones for environmental conservation.</h2>
    <p>
      This project is associated with the <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/rainforest">XPrize Rainforest</a> competition.

      The aim of this project is to build an interface to help reduce the likelihood of collisions with objects when a drone is launched into a forest.

      A “critic” is required to give basic instructions to the user controlling the drone through an interface. This interface allows a less experienced pilot to leverage object-avoidance techniques possessed by more experienced pilots to help prevent a collision. This reduces the likelihood of damage to the drone in flight or the total loss of the drone.

    <p>
      This project is important because it makes collisions leading to damage to the drone less likely, which also reduces the chance that the drone will need to be repaired, which can be an expensive and tedious process that would be made even more difficult in the rainforest. In addition this would allow for smoother operations of drones in the rainforest environment while ecological data is collected. Additionally, the project is the first step in building autonomy into the overall XPrize drone project.

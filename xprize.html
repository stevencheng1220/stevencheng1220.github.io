    <h1>Rainforest Conservation with Drones</h1>
    <h2>Developing drones for environmental conservation.</h2>
    <p>
      This project is associated with the <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/rainforest">XPrize Rainforest</a>, a five-year competition to enhance the understanding of the rainforest ecosystem. The aim of this project is to build an interface to help reduce the likelihood of object collisions when a drone is flying through a forest. In dense environments such as rainforests, manual control of drones often leads to crashes and entanglement of the drones.

    <p>
      As a result, we developed an interface that allows less experienced pilots to control the drones with object-avoidance support embedded into the system. Whenever the drone flies too close to an object, it will automatically stop and prohibit the pilot to fly further. This reduces the likelihood of damage to the drone in flight or the total loss of the drone.
